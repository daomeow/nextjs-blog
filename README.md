## Description
 - This blog application was built in about a day and a half with Next.js and utilizes two dynamic routes, the ability to toggle between light and dark mode and includes end-to-end testing. Users have the ability to read blog posts about Next.js and to learn a little more about my family! 
 - [Click here](https://nextjs-blog-roan-seven.vercel.app/) to deploy the application
